    <h1>Gojo vs Sukuna and mahoraga</h1>
    <h2>my poor megumi</h2>
    <p>After the shibuya and yuji extermination arcs, Gojo is finally unsealed, to which he immediatly goes to kill kenjaku, but fraudkuna interfears the fight.
he then marks to for the fight in a few days.</p>

<p>Satoru Gojo returns to Tokyo Jujutsu High where the jujutsu sorcerers prepare and plan for the coming showdown with King of Curses. Kenjaku, Uraume, and Sukuna make their own preparations as well. Sukuna consumes the head of his mummified corpse to substitute the power of his last missing finger and Kenjaku arranges the end of the Culling Game. After a month passes by, Christmas Eve arrives, the agreed-upon date for the clash between the strongest sorcerers.
Gojo travels to Shibuya with Utahime, Gakuganji, and Ijichi. Together, they enact a ritual using Utahime's Solo Forbidden Area technique to boost the output of Gojo's Hollow Purple to 200%. He fires Purple all the way to Shinjuku where Sukuna lies in wait. Ijichi's barrier prevents Sukuna from reading the move until the last moment, leading him to lose both his reinforced arms in the blast. Gojo teleports to Shinjuku to greet his opponent, taunting him for being the challenger in this battle of the strongest.</p>


<p>The mere warm-up clash between the two tears through entire areas of the "Makyo" Shinjuku. Gojo's allies watch from a monitoring room using Mei Mei's ability to share senses using Black Bird Manipulation. While talking about the abilities of both fighters, the possible result of a clash of expanded domains becomes the main topic of discussion. As if on cue, Gojo and Sukuna activate domain expansion simultaneously. Their domains are equally refined and cancel out one another's can't-miss attack, but Sukuna's barrier is open. Using the superior range of his domain, Sukuna slashes apart the outside of Gojo's barrier, which is weak to external attacks. Domain expansion exhausts Gojo's technique, leaving him vulnerable to the relentless slashes of Malevolent Shrine.</p>

<p>Gojo uses reverse cursed technique at maximum output to heal himself as Sukuna's slashes barrage him. He's unable to escape the range of Malevolent Shrine and buys himself time using simple domain. Sukuna's barrier tears the simple domain apart and Gojo is backed into a corner. He activates simple domain again without healing himself, concerning those watching with the thought he could actually lose. However, rather than buying time to heal himself, Gojo uses reverse cursed technique to somehow restore his exhausted Limitless technique. This shouldn't be possible and confuses everyone watching the battle. Gojo uses the opening to make a surprise counterattack, blasting Sukuna with a point-blank Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.</p>

<p>Sukuna extends the range of Malevolent Shrine to its maximum and Gojo expands Unlimited Void once again. This time he reverses the internal and external conditions of his barrier, making it more resistant to attacks from the outside. Sukuna counters by using a binding vow to negate his can't-miss attack on the inside of the domain in exchange for higher output slashes on the outside of Gojo's barrier. Sukuna shatters Unlimited Void again but Gojo is better prepared this time. He uses Falling Blossom Emotion to counter the slashes, delaying long enough to restore his burnt-out technique. Gojo opens his domain again, confusing the onlookers. They're even more surprised when Gojo expands the size of the barrier to great lengths before shrinking it down to the size of a small sports ball.</p>

<p>The increased density of this tiny barrier makes it far more resistant to Sukuna's slashes. After three minutes of fighting inside the domain, Sukuna shatters the barrier once again. However, Gojo simultaneously deals enough damage to Sukuna to the point where he can no longer maintain his domain. Both their domains crumble and the two fighters clash once again. Despite what should be a clear advantage, Gojo feels uneasy. Not only has Sukuna refrained from activating Megumi's Ten Shadows Technique, but he destroys Unlimited Void from the outside instead of attacking from the inside when the conditions are reversed. As Mahoraga's wheel turns in an unspecified place, Gojo suffers from a sudden nosebleed.</p>

<p>Gojo and Sukuna replenish their exhausted techniques and then activate domain expansion simultaneously once again. Sukuna is damaged to the point where he can't maintain his domain at the same time that Gojo's barrier shatters from the outside. The next time they expand their domains, Gojo is less than 0.01 seconds faster than Sukuna, enough for Unlimited Void to hit with minimal effect. This staggers Sukuna for just a moment, giving Gojo the opening to crush his heart with a single blow. Their fight continues until Sukuna can no longer maintain his domain and he's bathed in the full power of Unlimited Void. Gojo is poised to finish Sukuna off but Mahoraga is suddenly summoned inside the domain. To Gojo's shock, Mahoraga destroys Unlimited Void in an instant, having already adapted to it.</p>

<p> Gojo figures out Megumi's soul has been bearing Mahoraga's adaptation. The repeated exposure to Unlimited Void allowed Mahoraga's adaptation to trigger. Gojo is unable to open his domain again and bleeds more profusely from his nose. He was first damaging the technique engraving in his brain with cursed energy and then healing it with reverse cursed technique to forcibly recover his exhausted technique. The same thing happens to Sukuna when he attempts to use domain expansion as well. While Sukuna forcibly recovered his exhausted technique fewer times than Gojo, the damage done to his brain by Unlimited Void made up for the difference. Gojo gains his second wind and lands a powerful blow to begin round two of the battle of the strongest.</p>

<p>Mahoraga's wheel turns as Sukuna fights, signaling a countdown until he adapts to Gojo's technique. Sukuna will adapt to the Infinity after the wheel turns five times and Gojo fights to win before that happens. Gojo uses only Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue to prevent Mahoraga from adapting to cursed technique reversal. Mahoraga's wheel spins twice more before Gojo uses advantageous timing to hit Sukuna with Red. He follows up with Black Flash and incapacitates Sukuna, causing the wheel to fall from his head. It appears as if Gojo has won until the wheel turns again and Mahoraga retakes the field. It's adapted to the Infinity and slashes Gojo across the shoulder.</p>

<p>Losing is not something Gojo's allies ever thought him capable of. The fear of his defeat floods their minds for the first time but Gojo is overcome with a different sensation, satisfaction. Sukuna also uses the Ten Shadows Technique to summon Merged Beast Agito, making it a three-on-one fight against Gojo. Finally able to test himself, Gojo fights off his opponents. However, when its output is recovered with an incantation, Red isn't enough to destroy Mahoraga in a single blow. With this in mind, Gojo knows the only way to win is to unleash Hollow Purple.</p>

<p>Yuta and some of the other students want him to enter the battle to support Gojo. Kusakabe and Mei Mei explain that their best chance of victory is to allow Gojo to fight alone and unhindered. Sukuna knows he will have to fight all of Gojo's allies immediately after his defeat. Conversely, Gojo can go all out against Sukuna because he's the only target. Mahoraga adapts further to the Infinity and hits Gojo with a flying slash that severs his arm. Vulnerable, Gojo suffers direct hits from Mahoraga and Sukuna, but counters Agito and destroys it using Blue at maximum output before he falls to too great a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Gojo heals his arm and fires Red into the sky where it can merge with the orb of Blue that destroyed Agito. Sukuna and Mahoraga attempt to impede it but Gojo stops them back with clever use of his Blue ability to attract. Red and Blue combine, resulting in an unknown mass that rushes forth and explodes. Mahoraga along with its wheel are disintegrated and Sukuna is heavily injured in the massive explosion. Gojo's reversed cursed technique output returned thanks to unleashing several Black Flashes while fighting the shikigami. Considering the shape each fighter is in, the Jujutsu High sorcerers safely assume Gojo is the victor.</p>

<p>However, Sukuna uses Mahoraga's adaptation as a model for him to bypass the Infinity. Mahoraga's first adaptation was something Sukuna couldn't imitate. Its further adaptation to the Infinity expanded its target to "slash the world". This would strike down everything in range regardless of the Infinity because it exists within that space. Sukuna applies this to his Dismantle with a binding vow that bisects and kills Gojo. With Satoru Gojos defeated, the Jujutsu High sorcerers and their allies begin their raid on a weakened Sukuna.
